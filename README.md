# Projects-and-Code-Snippets

Welcome! 

Here are some small projects and code snippets I have created throughout college. Unfortunately, I lost most of my files in Fall 2021, and I do not have permission to share my class projects publicly. Therefore, this repository is mainly composed of codes I found wihtin my email inbox. I don't believe this repository currently captures the entirety of my coding ability, however, these snippets should provide evidence of some foundational R knowledge in the domain of data science. 

Happy reading! :)
